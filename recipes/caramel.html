        <h1>Caramel Candy</h1>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup Butter</li>
            <li>4 cups granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 cups light corn syrup</li>
            <li>24 ounces evaporated milk</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>Sea Salt (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Line a 9x13" pan with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>
                Add butter, sugar and corn syrup to a large saucepan. Stir over
                medium heat until mixture begins to boil, about 5-10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add evaporated milk extremely gradually, patience is important.
                It may take up to 15 minutes to add a single can of milk. Stir
                contantly, make sure a steady heat is maintained.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir mixture constantly, while also scraping the sides. Do this
                until your reach 240-245 degrees F. Double check with the Ice
                Water Method.
                <a href="#ice-water-method">See Below.</a>
            </li>
            <li>Remove from heat and add vanilla.</li>
            <li>
                Pour caramels into pan (Add sea salt if desired) and refrigerate
                for at least a few hours but overnight is preferable. This makes
                it easier to cut and wrap if desired. (They will be hard in the
                frige but soft at room temperature.)
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Use a heavy bottom saucepan with a lot of space in case the
                carmel bubbles. Avoid non-stick.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make sure there are no impurities in your sugar, pan, or
                spatula. Remove sugar lumps.
            </li>
            <li>If your carmel is too soft it needs to cook longer</li>
            <li>If your carmel is too hard it cooked for too long</li>
            <li id="ice-water-method">
                <span style="font-weight: bold">Ice Water Method: </span>
                instead of using a candy thermometer you can test if your carmel
                is ready with some ice water. Spoon some carmel into a cup of
                ice water and attempt to mold the carmel into a ball. If it is
                firm, pliable, and sticky it is ready.
            </li>
            <li>Carmel may begin to foam, this is normal.</li>
        </ul>
